# Neovim Configuration Modernization

## Project Overview
Audit and modernization of Neovim configuration based on 2024-2025 community trends from r/neovim.

## Current State Analysis (Completed)

### Configuration Base
- **Framework**: LazyVim (modern ✅)
- **Plugin Manager**: lazy.nvim (modern ✅)
- **Location**: `nvim/.config/nvim/`

### Outdated Components Identified

#### 1. LSP Setup with Mason ❌ **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Current**: Mason-managed LSP servers
- **Issue**: Community moving away from Mason due to complexity
- **Location**: `nvim/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/lsp.lua`
- **Impact**: Maintenance overhead, version conflicts

#### 2. Completion Engine ❌ **CRITICAL**
- **Current**: nvim-cmp
- **Issue**: LazyVim v14 switched to blink.cmp as default
- **Performance Gap**: blink.cmp offers 6x faster fuzzy matching (0.5-4ms async)
- **Location**: `nvim/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/completion.lua`

#### 3. Fuzzy Finder ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- **Current**: Telescope with live-grep-args
- **Trend**: LazyVim v14 switched to fzf-lua for performance
- **Impact**: Slower on large codebases
- **Location**: `nvim/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/telescope-live-grep-args.lua`

### Modern Components ✅
- nvim-lspconfig (current)
- lazy.nvim plugin manager (current)
- nvim-treesitter (current)
- nvim-dap ecosystem (current)

## Modernization Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Updates
1. **Replace nvim-cmp with blink.cmp**
   - Remove `lua/plugins/completion.lua`
   - Add blink.cmp configuration
   - Migrate snippet and completion sources

2. **Simplify LSP Setup** 
   - Remove Mason for language servers
   - Use direct system package manager installation
   - Streamline `lua/plugins/lsp.lua`

### Phase 2: Performance Optimizations
3. **Consider fzf-lua Migration**
   - Evaluate performance gains vs Telescope familiarity
   - Test on large codebases
   - Migrate telescope-live-grep-args functionality

### Phase 3: Maintenance
4. **Plugin Version Updates**
   - Review lazy-lock.json for outdated commits
   - Enable auto-updates for stable plugins

## Implementation Notes

### LSP Migration Strategy
- Keep current working Elixir setup (already using direct binary)
- Focus Python setup migration from Mason to system-managed
- Preserve custom diagnostic and inlay hint configurations

### Completion Migration - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: Successfully replaced nvim-cmp with blink.cmp
- **Changes Made**:
  - Replaced `lua/plugins/completion.lua` with blink.cmp configuration
  - Updated LSP configs to use `blink.cmp.get_lsp_capabilities()`
  - Disabled conflicting nvim-cmp plugins in `lua/plugins/disabled.lua`
  - Preserved LuaSnip integration and custom keybindings (`<C-,>`, `<C-m>`)
  - Maintained Copilot integration via `blink-cmp-copilot`
  - Kept original completion keybindings: `<C-n>`, `<C-p>`, `<C-y>`, `<C-e>`
- **Configuration loaded successfully** - basic syntax check passed

### Performance Expectations
- blink.cmp: 6x faster fuzzy matching
- fzf-lua: Significant improvement on large projects
- Reduced startup time with simplified LSP setup

## Community Trends Context
- LazyVim v14 (late 2024) made these changes default
- Mason criticism: complexity, maintenance overhead
- Performance focus: Rust-based tools gaining adoption
- Simplification trend: direct package management preferred

## Next Steps
1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Replace nvim-cmp with blink.cmp
2. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Fixed .claude/settings.local.json gitignore
3. **NEXT**: Test completion functionality in real development workflow
4. Implement Phase 2: LSP Migration (Mason removal)
5. Consider Phase 3: fzf-lua migration

## Recent Changes
- **Fixed Git Ignore**: Added `.claude/settings.local.json` to `.gitignore` and removed from git cache
  - This file contains local environment-specific settings and should not be committed
  - File remains local but is now properly ignored by git

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Completion performance and accuracy
- [ ] Snippet expansion
- [ ] Copilot integration
- [ ] Python virtual environment detection
- [ ] Elixir development workflow
- [ ] Fuzzy finding performance
- [ ] DAP debugging functionality
