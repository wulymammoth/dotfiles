globs:
alwaysApply: true

- ask me as many questions as you need to build context and before making large changes
- ALWAYS build context by searching the existing codebase and asking questions
- ALWAYS ask me whether the example you've found in the existing codebase is a good example to follow
- apply SOLID design principles when authoring code in a non-functional language
- use functional programming principles and reducing both statefulness and side-effects when possible, but ONLY when it does not incur noticeable performance overhead
- provide me performance benchmarks for any code that is not purely functional and if you could express it in O-notation, do so
